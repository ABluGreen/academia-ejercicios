## Largest Paliandrome Product

A palindromic number reads the same both ways.

The **first argument and only argument** sets the requirement for the **total digits** in a factor.
	
	```
    10 is a two-digit number
    1996 is a four-digit number
	```

1. Find the largest palindrome made from the product of 2 two-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
1. Find the largest palindrome made from the product of 2 three-digit numbers. Write two tests that check the return object for the correct factor values.

Do your work in the `largestPaliandromeProduct.js` file.


## Even Fibonacci Numbers

Each new number in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two Fibonacci numbers. For example by starting with the numbers `1` and `2` being the first and second numbers in the Fibonacci sequence, the first 10 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence looks like this:

```
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89
```

**The Exercise**
You will be given a stub function in the file `evenFibNums.js`. This function accepts one argument, `maxFibValue` which is a `Number`.

Remember, `maxFibValue` is the **max** value of a fibonacci number, it is **NOT** the **Nth** fibonacci number in the sequence.

You goal will be to sum up all the **Even Numbers** that are less than or equal to, but does not exceed, the `maxFibValue` given to you.


## Largest Prime Factor

The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.

What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?
